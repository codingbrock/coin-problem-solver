# About
I was given a question in a math test that essentially required me to find how many numbers (under 100) that could be created of 3 and 5.
I was curious enough to create this. It's far from perfect, but it's a good start.

I have just found out this is known as 'The Coin Problem' or the 'Frobenius problem' and have updated the name.


## Instructions
1. Input the highest number you wish to seek to. (In my case, it was 100.)
2. Input the first number. e.g. '3'
3. Input the second number. e.g. '5'

Note: Don't use negative numbers for any of these or '1' for the first or second number or it'll break.

Good Luck!
